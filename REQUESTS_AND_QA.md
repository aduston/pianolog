1. Request: Right now when the pianolog UI is in the "stats" screen and someone plays a note, it plays C-E-G. If the person then plays their identifying note, the UI shows the "practice" screen and a session begins. I would like to add another screen: the "user selection" screen. This is shown when someone plays a note from the "stats" screen. The user selection screen shows a list of users and their activating notes, but it also has a button next to each user. The user can click this button to identify themselves (instead of playing their activating note). Whether they identify themselves through a button click or activating note, once they activate themselves they still go the "practice" screen and, in the backend, the session has begun.
2. ~~Request: from the user management screen, we have tried to activate the system keyboard when in kiosk mode. This has been challenging and still doesn't work. An alternative is https://furcan.github.io/KioskBoard/. I think we should try using kioskboard and get rid of the current solution attempt. It would be great if Kioskboard only showed up when the page is being rendered in a browser in kiosk mode. If the page is being rendered in a desktop or mobile browser, there's no need for it to appear.~~
