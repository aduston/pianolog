1. QA: I'm in the stats screen and I turn off the piano. Then I turn the piano back on. I click the "Retry Connection" button. This should trigger automatic power cycling (bypassing any cooldown period), and the button should stay disabled until the USB connection is back. (See USAGE.md for details on power cycling).
2. ~~Request: When in "practice" mode, after 10 seconds elapses since the playing of the last key, a countdown timer should appear on the "practice" screen and show how many seconds are left until the session ends.~~
3. ~~Request: The index.html webpage should be open in kiosk mode on the raspberry pi display. To do this, I think we need a "kiosk script" that is put into autostart.~~
4. QA: I press a key on the piano. The C-E-G notes play. I press "C" to identify myself as "Dad". The screen says "No active session (Dad)" and shows two buttons so I can identify myself as Dad. Expectation: the screen says that Dad is practicing, since I have already identified myself by pressing C. There is some nondeterminism here; I repro about 1/2 the time. It should be impossible for the screen to ever say "No active session". If there is no active session, then the screen should be in "stats" mode. Let's please delete the screen state that say "No active session".
